# Computational Chemistry

---
# Purpose

Bridge between theory and experiment
Lets you look at ‘reality’ all along a pathway, that can't be probed experimentally.

# MD specific questions

* what is the force field?

-- 

* how to prepare your system?

-- 

* what conditions to use (P,V,n,T)?

# Common challenges
- MD scripting languages can be complex. easy to make errors in files (untested)
- unforced errors in command line arguments and flags
- verification and testing
- repeating the simulation, errors can result. Auditing.
- sharing 
- idiosyncracies of the MD engine inhibit use

# Use Galaxy

Batteries included!

- workflow views and histories
- platform for inhouse tool testing and linking
- aim to reduce tools breaking due to human failure (reduce unforced errors)
- reproducibility / repeatability 
- data typing
