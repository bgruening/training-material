# Computational Chemistry

---
# Purpose

- Bridge between theory and experiment.
- "Lets you look at ‘reality’ all along a pathway, that can't be probed experimentally."

# Molecular Dynamics (MD)

TODO - GIF OF PROTEIN

- Numerical step-by-step solution of the classical equations of motion : F = ma
- Link macroscopic properties to microscopic molecular properties


---

# Molecular Dynamics (MD)
- N-body problem
- Define connectivity (topology) and parameters (chemistry of atoms in terms of a model)
- A molecule is described as charged balls (atoms) and springs (bonds)
- Then based on positions, calculate velocities, accelerations and forces.

# Requirements to build a realistic model
- Choose a force field
- Prepare system 
- Choose specific conditions

---

## Force fields

![](../images/Intramolecular_geometry_defined.png)

Topology and Parameter files
- Topology: atom types, charges, connectivities
- Parameters: Force constants and non-bonded interactions vdW and electrostatics)

For example the general CHARMM, AMBER, GROMOS etc.

### Steps in a typical MD simulation

1. Setup and preparation
  - Read PDB and parameters. Mutate residues, solvate, assign protonations states etc.

--

2. Minimisation
  - Find a low energy structure using the force field parameters

--

3. Heating
  - Heat the system to the desired temperature (usually 298K)

--

4. Equilibration
  - Let the system evolve at T and ensure the system is stable.

--

5. Production dynamics
  - Simulate the system under specified conditions (NVE, NVT, NPT)
  - Collect structure and velocity data

--

6. Analysis and analytics
  - Timeseries and Correlation, PCA


---

# Solvation

Rationale: Many biological events take place in aqueous media.
- Explicit: solvent molecules added (often water)
- Implicit: continuum dielectric

# Ensembles

A mental or virtual collection of a very large number of copies of a system. Each copy represents a possible state that the real system may be in.

*A statistical ensemble is a probability distribution for the state of the system.* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_ensemble_(mathematical_physics))

Thermodynamic ensembles are in statistical equilibrium over particular macroscopic properties
- Microcanonical  (constant N V E)
- Canonical (constant N V T)
- Gibbs or Isobaric-isothermal (constant N P T)

.footnote[N=number of particles, V=volume, P=Pressure, T=Temperature, [See Statistical Mechanics, McQuarrie for more in depth theory ISBN:9781891389153](https://books.google.co.za/books/about/Statistical_Mechanics.html?id=itcpPnDnJM0C&redir_esc=y)]

# Molecular Dynamics Engines

These are programs that create the ensemble (create trajectories).
- [CHARMM](https://www.charmm.org/charmm/)
- [NAMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/)
- GROMACS
- OpenMM

# Challenges faced
- Parameters

--

- Version control

--

- Sharing  inputs and data

--

- Ensuring the correct version is used and tracking changesa

--

- Scripts for serial vs parallel and for queueing systems

--

- Bespoke scripts that temp solve challenges and are not reusable in the lab. 

---

# Overcoming challenges
- Train team to use collaborative version control.

--

- Use coding practices etc. , this can be a whole new challenge (!)

--

- A community of practice using common workflows may be an easier barrier to entry

---
# Common challenges
- MD scripting languages can be complex. easy to make errors in files.

--

- unforced errors in command line arguments and flags

--

- verification and testing

--

- repeating the simulation, errors can result. Auditing.

--

- sharing 

--

- idiosyncracies of the MD engine inhibit use

---

# Why Galaxy 

Batteries included!

- workflow views and histories
- platform for inhouse tool testing and linking
- aim to reduce tools breaking due to human failure (reduce unforced errors)
- reproducibility / repeatability 
- data typing
