# What is MD analysis

---

Using outputs from MD simulations to look for trends in physical and chemical behaviour. 
* Timeseries analysis, distribution and correlation analysis are popular.

---

# Tools

- VMD (builtin plugins and custom scripts)
- MDAnalysis
- MDTraj
- Bio3D

---

# Tools that are in Galaxy
- Bio3d suite (PCA etc.)
- MDanalysis suite (timeseries etc.)

---

# Standard structural analysis

# RMSD
Root mean square deviation of atomic positions. 
A measure of quantitative similarity. 

--- 

---

# RMSF
A measure of conformational variance
Can be linked to spectroscopic outcomes (experimental)
$$P(AB) = \frac{\lvert AB \rvert}{\lvert U \rvert}$$ and $$P(B) = \frac{\lvert B \rvert}{\lvert U \rvert}$$

f_i=sqrt((1/(M-1))Sum_j(||r_i^j-r_i^0||^2))
, where f_i is the RMSF value for the ith atom, M the total number of frames (total number of rows of xyz), r_i^j the positional vector of the ith atom in the jth frame, and r_i^0 the mean position of ith atom. ||r|| denotes the Euclidean norm of the vector r.

## PCA
Principal component analysis

Convert from a set of correlated observations (movement of all atoms in protein) to a set of principal components which are linearly independent (or uncorrelated).
The first PCA has the highest variance and so on. 
Useful to find important modes of the protein.
