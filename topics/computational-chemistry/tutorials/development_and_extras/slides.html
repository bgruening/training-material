## IN DEVELOPMENT

---

### Overview

A brief overview of tools development and other exciting things that can be done.

- Jupyter 
- Automation against server
- New tools development

---

### Why use Jupyter

- keep data and do vis on the server
- try out ideas (esp. where tools do not exist)
- alternatively work in a JupyterHub elsewhere and move to Galaxy when ready

---

### Scripting for Automation
- Form filling can get tedious
- have multiple ideas to try and can automate them. 
- will still require human interaction but can more efficiently create multiple systems
Use Bioblend - https://github.com/galaxyproject/bioblend https://bioblend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_docs/galaxy/all.html

---

### Tools development and contribution
- Use planemo https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo
