## IN DEVELOPMENT

### Overview

A brief overview of tools development and other exciting things that can be done.

Jupyter 
Automation against server

### Why use Jupyter

keep data and do vis on the server
try out ideas (esp. where tools do not exist)
can share this stuff

### Scripting for Automation
Form filling getting annoying
have multiple ideas to try and can automate them. 

will still require human interaction but can more efficiently create multiple systems

Keep this in GitHub
