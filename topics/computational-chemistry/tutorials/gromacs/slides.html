![](images/logo.png)
- Download structure from PDB or obtain from another source
- Perform MD runs using the open-source GROMACS package

---

## Process
- Upload data to Galaxy
- Use GROMACS tools to run:
  - Construction of a topology
  - Solvation of the protein
  - Energy minimization
  - Equilibration with NVT/NPT ensembles
  - Production simulation
