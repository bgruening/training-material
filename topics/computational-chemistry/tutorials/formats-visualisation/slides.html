# POINT TO EXISTING RESOURCES

http://127.0.0.1:4000/training-material/topics/galaxy-ui/tutorials/history/tutorial.html

Histories: Understanding Galaxy history system

http://127.0.0.1:4000/training-material/topics/galaxy-ui/tutorials/galaxy-intro-jupyter/tutorial.html
Jupyter: Use Jupyter notebooks in Galaxy
http://127.0.0.1:4000/training-material/topics/galaxy-ui/tutorials/history-to-workflow/tutorial.html
Create a reusable workflow from a history

### Supported Formats

PDB (by default)
DCD (in the latest release, and special install) see https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/6613)
Gromacs (in the latest release, and special install) see https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/6655
https://galaxyproject.org/learn/datatypes/
Add a new format is as easy as a pull request or custom format file on your Galaxy instance. 

### Viewing inside Galaxy

https://galaxyproject.org/learn/visualization/charts/

Screen shots of viewing a protein model (would have done this before with the first part of the course?)

http://nglviewer.org/ngl/ and this may be fully integrated at some point.

### hint at using Jupyter
Jupyter and Galaxy: Easing entry barriers into complex data analyses for biomedical researchers DOI: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005425
---

### Using VMD for viewing
http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/
which for now requires downloading of the dataset - this may change ( and hopefully will for large datasets). 

Alternative is to complete analysis using tools in Galaxy (work with data directly on the server.)
