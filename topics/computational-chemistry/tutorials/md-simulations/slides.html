### Running MD simulations
---

### The usual flow (NVT/NPT)
- what is the force field?
- how to prepare your system?
- what conditions to use (P,V,n,T)?
---

### MD engines available in BRIDGE
- CHARMM
- NAMD
- Gromacs
---

### Existing tools for...
- Setup
- NVT
- NPT

---
### Process
- upload data
- use existing workflows with default selections

*Will use structure and topology along with forcefields to generate trajectories.
